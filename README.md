This repository contains questions and the solutions for it.
The questions have been taken from various sources and the difficulty level can vary between easy, medium or hard.

**The questions can be divided into various subtopics.**

### Conditionals and Loops
[Fibonacci](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/NthFibonacciNumber) To find the Nth number in the fibonacci list

[Reverse of a Number](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/ReverseOfANumber) has the solution to reverse a number.

### Patterns

[Pyramid Number Pattern](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/PyramidNumberPattern) are numbers in the shape of a Pyramid.

[Alpha Pattern](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/blob/master/AlphaPattern) are patterns that are made with alphabets instead of symbols or integers.

[Arrow Pattern](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/ArrowPattern) is an arrow shaped pattern built using *

[Zeros and Stars Pattern](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/ZerosAndStarsPattern) are where you might need to think a tad bit harder than the usual patterns.

### Searching and Sorting
[Binary Search](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/BinarySearch) is one of the most commonly used search algorithm which needs a sorted array to perform the search algorithm.

[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/BubbleSort) puts the largest element at the end in each round of sort that it performs.

[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/InsertionSort) keeps putting an element from the unsorted list to the sorted list. 

[Merge Two Sorted Arrays](https://github.com/karanmalh0tra/python-coding/tree/master/MergeTwoSortedArrays) can be solved by using the fundamentals of sorting algorithms.


### Strings


### Two-Dimensional Lists
